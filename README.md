# shimmer_UL_metrics_pipeline
This pipeline code was developed as part of a research project conducted over a period of 6 weeks at the FHT in Singapore. The goal of the project was to review and select which metrics are optimal to monitor upper limb (UL) use in daily life (DL) and to compute these metrics using Shimmer IMU sensors to validate the selection.

The research question addressed in this project was "Which metrics are the most representative of the upper limb use in daily life when using IMU sensors?" The dataset used for this project is a 24-hour recording of daily usage of the upper limb.
